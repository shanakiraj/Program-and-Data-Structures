# UVA CS2150 - Program and Data Representation 
Spring 2021 Lab writeups can be found at https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/labs/index.html

This repository contains all of my programming assignments from the CS2150 course, which focuses on programming and data structures. The assignments cover a variety of topics, including Huffman encoding, graphs, linked lists, stack implementation with prefix and postfix notations, number representation, binary search trees, AVL trees, hash tables, and an introduction to x86 assembly programming.

## Huffman Encoding

Huffman Encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns shorter codes to more frequently occurring characters and longer codes to less frequently occurring ones. The algorithm uses a priority queue to build a binary tree, which is then used for encoding and decoding the data.

## Graphs

This project deals with graph data structures and the implementation of graph traversal algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). Graphs are widely used in computer science to represent relationships between objects.

**Directory:** `lab11/`

## Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. This project focuses on implementing a singly-linked list with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

**Directory:** `lab2/`

## Prefix and Postfix Stack Implementation

This project covers the implementation of a stack data structure and the evaluation of mathematical expressions in prefix (Polish) and postfix (Reverse Polish) notation. Stacks are Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structures, which make them suitable for evaluating expressions.

**Directory:** `lab3/`

## Number Representation

This project explores various number representations, such as binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal, as well as the conversion between these representations. Understanding different number representations is essential for working with computer systems and programming languages.

**Directory:** `lab4/`

## Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees

This project involves the implementation of binary search trees (BST) and AVL trees. A binary search tree is a binary tree where each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. AVL trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree that maintain their height-balanced property, ensuring that the tree remains efficient for search, insertion, and deletion operations.

**Directory:** `lab5/`

## Hashtable/Hashing

This project focuses on the implementation of hash tables, a data structure that provides fast insertion, deletion, and search operations using hash functions. Hash tables store key-value pairs and use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

**Directory:** `lab6/`

## Ibcm (Intro to x86 Assembly)

This project introduces x86 assembly programming through the use of the IBCM (Itty Bitty Computing Machine) language, a simplified assembly language. IBCM provides a basic understanding of how assembly languages work and how they can be used to manipulate data at a low level in computer systems.

**Directory:** `lab7/`

## x86 Assembly

This project dives deeper into x86 assembly programming, covering various instructions, addressing modes, and control structures. Assembly language programming is crucial for tasks such as writing operating systems, device drivers, and performance-critical code.
